# 3D Grass Shader
I have written a tutorial of how to implement this on my [3D Grass Shader with Distortion & Wind](https://gameidea.org/2023/12/03/3d-grass-shader-with-distortion-wind/) post. In this shader, player can interact with the grass. The grass blades tilt when player is standing on them. Also, it has wind & you can control the intensity of it.

## Breakdown
1. Majority of part right now is vertex shader.
2. I have not put much effort into fragment shader, but you can make it look uch better by implementing a good grass fragment shader.
